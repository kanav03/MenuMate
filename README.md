# Menu Buddy

Menu Buddy is a mobile application designed to bridge communication gaps for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals in restaurant settings. The app simplifies the food ordering process, eliminating communication barriers between deaf customers and restaurant staff.

## The Problem

Deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals often face significant challenges when dining out:
- Difficulty communicating orders to wait staff who don't know sign language
- Misunderstandings leading to incorrect orders
- Reduced independence in the dining experience

Menu Buddy was built specifically to address these accessibility issues, empowering deaf individuals to enjoy dining out with greater confidence and independence.
